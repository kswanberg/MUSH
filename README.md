# MUSH: Making Unnecessary Separation Harmonious 

Making Unnecessary Separation Harmonious (MUSH) merges single-channel TIFFs into two-channel files for further processing. 


### Inputs

Upon function run the user will be prompted to select an input directory expected to contain two columns of filepaths to single-channel TIFF files to be mushed. 


### Outputs

MUSH outputs merged two-channel TIFFs into the working directory (typically the folder in which the script lives unless otherwise defined) a directory with the prefix "MUSH_Outputs_" and a suffix based on the date-time, and which contains the following contents, wherein 'X' is the name of the input image.
